# Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.
## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.     
The class should contain the following methods    
1. **insert**:Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.     

2. **includes** Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.    

3. **to string** Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"



## Approach & Efficiency
big o(1) and o(n)

## API

insert   
append   
includs   
toString
