## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
 I useed if statment to check the condition that we need and use while loop to loop through of linked list.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
npm test linked-list
