# Hashtables
A hashtable is a data structure used to store data as key/value pairs.

A hashtable is traditionally created from an array. Each Index of the array is known as a bucket; since it can store multiple key/value pairs. To cover the case of collisions, buckets can be linked lists, arrays, or any other data structure.

The hashtable uses a hashing algorithm that encodes the key to map the value to a specific bucket in the array. In other words, the hash generates the index of the arrayâ€™s bucket in which the value is stored.
## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:   

    set  
        That have arguments: key, value
        And it returns: nothing
        This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.
        Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.
    get
        Arguments: key
        Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
    contains
        Arguments: key
        Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
    keys
        Returns: Collection of keys
    hash
        Arguments: key
        Returns: Index in the collection for that key
